    ### Welcome to the Financial Nexus

This application is designed to assist in calculating flexible loan repayment plans, determining loan eligibility, and assessing loan risk based on detailed customer data.

### Overview:
- **Dataset**: The system contains data for 200 customers.
- **Eligibility Criteria**: A customer is eligible for a loan if they demonstrate consistency in at least one of the following areas for 12 months:
  - **Credit Purchases**
  - **Data Purchases**
  - **Mobile Money (MoMo) Cash Inflow**
- **Flexible Repayment Plan**: The repayment plan is dynamically structured based on the customer's MoMo cash inflow, ensuring affordability during both high and low-income months.
- **Risk Assessment**: Loan risk is calculated by analyzing the customer's expenditure patterns and MoMo cash inflow, helping to gauge the potential risk associated with granting the loan.

### How to Use:
- Use the sidebar to input the customer's ID and the desired loan amount.
- Select an operation to either check loan eligibility, calculate a repayment plan, or assess loan risk.

This tool offers a comprehensive and tailored approach to loan management, ensuring both customer satisfaction and financial security.
